## About Accessibility for People with Cognitive and Learning Disabilities

Cognitive and learning disabilities impact how people process information. For example, it can affect people's perception, memory, language, and attention. Terminology for categories and conditions varies, and includes intellectual disabilities, developmental disabilities, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism, dementia, dyslexia, and more.

Technology provides opportunities for people to interact with content and to process information in ways that are more usable to them. For example, people can:
* navigate web content using different strategies
* access information in text, audio, or other formats
* change the presentation of the content according to their individual needs or preferences

There are many things that designers and developers can do to avoid accessibility barriers, and to optimize the user experience of people with cognitive and learning disabilities.

More information and specific examples of disabilities and barriers are in a section of "How People with Disabilities Use the Web: Diverse Abilities and Barriers": [Cognitive and learning](https://www.w3.org/WAI/people-use-web/abilities-barriers/#cognitive).

## Cognitive Accessibility in W3C Standards

Existing and developing standards from the W3C Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) address many aspects of cognitive accessibility. For example, Web Content Accessibility Guidelines ([WCAG](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/)) includes requirements (called "success criteria") that improve cognitive accessibility under these and other guidelines:

* [Guideline 1.3 Adaptable](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/adaptable): Create content that can be presented in different ways (for example simpler layout) without losing information or structure.
* [Guideline 2.2 Enough Time](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/enough-time): Provide users enough time to read and use content.
* [Guideline 2.4 Navigable](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/navigable): Provide ways to help users navigate, find content, and determine where they are.
* [Guideline 3.1 Readable](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/readable): Make text content readable and understandable.
* [Guideline 3.2 Predictable](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/predictable): Make Web pages appear and operate in predictable ways.
* [Guideline 3.3 Input Assistance](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/input-assistance): Help users avoid and correct mistakes.

The WCAG Understanding documents and techniques, including advisory techniques, provide additional guidance on cognitive accessibility. These documents are introduced in a section of the WCAG Overview: [What is in the WCAG 2 Documents](What is in the WCAG 2 Documents).

## Additional Support for Cognitive Accessibility

Some cognitive accessibility user needs are not addressed in existing WAI guidelines.

WAI is actively working to provide additional guidance on cognitive accessibility, including:

* developing "supplemental guidance" beyond what fits into accessibility standards now
* developing potential additional requirements for future versions of accessibility standards
* developing standards for personalization, which is a key aspect of cognitive accessibility

## Cognitive Accessibility Work at W3C

Current work on cognitive accessibility at W3C WAI is mostly focused in the following Task Forces under the Accessibility Guidelines Working Group ([AG WG](https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/)) and the Accessible Platform Architectures ([APA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/APA/)) Working Group:

* [Cognitive and Learning Disabilities Accessibility Task Force (COGA)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/PF/cognitive-a11y-tf/) &mdash; Resources in development are listed in the [wiki main page](https://www.w3.org/WAI/PF/cognitive-a11y-tf/wiki/Main_Page).
* [Personalization Task Force](https://www.w3.org/WAI/APA/task-forces/personalization/) &mdash; Resources in development are introduced in the [Personalization Overview]( https://deploy-preview-2--wai-personalization-standards.netlify.com/standards-guidelines/personalization/)<!-- @@ update link -->.
